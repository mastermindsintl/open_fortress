'Operation Crossfire' was the last stand of the Reliable Excavation & Demolition company's plans to win the war against Builder's League United. It concerned a nuclear test site housing a fully functional atomic warhead, which would have been used against the BLU team had it not been for the intervention of TF Industries agents sent to eliminate the project's overseers in order to ensure the continued flow of profit made for the companies investing in the Gravel War, which would have ended victoriously had the operation continued.
