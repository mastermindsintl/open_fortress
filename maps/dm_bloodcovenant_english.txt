It looks like those architects at Reliable Excavation & Demolition should've done their research. What was supposed to be a top-secret chemical plant was accidentally built at the exact latitude and longitude of some evil cult's sacrificial grounds. Come ritual season, the plant was stormed with cultists, and now RED has to hire a crew of mercs just to keep them out. Unfortunately, none of the mercs seem to know who is and is not a cultist, and now seem to be running around killing themselves instead. On the bright side, the blood sacrifices were able to be completed without a single cultist being harmed.
