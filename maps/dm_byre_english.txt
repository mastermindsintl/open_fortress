A modest trainyard in the countryside which was once the center of a landgrab battle between RED and BLU cut short by visitors from another world. Upon realizing the threat, rather than teaming up to take down the imposing flying saucer, they fought to be the ones to take it down themselves, seeking fame and recognition. After the destruction of the UFo the teams' memories of the event were wiped by undercover agents from TF Industries, hoping to keep what really happened here under wraps.
