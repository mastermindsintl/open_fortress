'Project Aerowalk' was a Level-Three security clearance weapons test project furthered by Reliable Excavation & Demolitions with the express intent on combining teleportation technology with conventional anti-aircraft projectiles, with sponsorship and funding from Telemax Co. to use their Slipgate prototype. Following a freak accident involving a miscalculated Slipgate, the site was quickly submerged in hazardous materials, reducing its former staff to bone.
